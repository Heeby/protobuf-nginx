Changes with protobuf-nginx 1.1                                  24 Apr 2013

    *) Added support for unknown fields.  Unknown fields are parsed into
       an array of ngx_protobuf_unknown_field_t.  Generation of this code
       can be suppressed by setting the following file-level option:

       options optimize_for = LITE_RUNTIME;

    *) Added __is_initialized methods for messages.  For messages with
       required fields, methods return 1 if all required fields are
       defined and 0 otherwise.  Otherwise (i.e. for messages with no 
       required fields), methods always return a value of 1.

Changes with protobuf-nginx 1.0                                  19 Apr 2013

    *) Initial release
